libpod (4.6.2+ds1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Podman 4.6 changes the default storage driver from vfs to overlay.
  The overlay driver has been available for some time, but it had to be
  enabled explicitly in the Debian version of podman. The overlay driver
  is generally much faster and uses less disk space than the vfs driver.

  To take advantage of overlay, it's necessary to delete the local
  container storage, destroying any containers you may currently
  have. Make sure to save or export any images, containers and volumes
  before doing so, or you will lose them!

  Some helpful commands:

  # save the filesystem of a container
  podman export -o important-container.tar important_container
  # save a volume
  podman volume export -o important-volume.tar important_volume
  # save all container images
  podman save -o images.tar

  # delete ~/.local/share/containers (!!!)

  # check that podman is using the overlay driver (!)
  podman info | grep graphDriverName

  # re-import all container images
  podman load -i images.tar
  # re-import a saved container filesystem as a container image
  podman import important-container.tar
  # re-import a volume
  podman volume import important_volume important-volume.tar
